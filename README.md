### Map
Add Google map api key to local.properties file
```
MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Maps Search
Maps search uses Google Places API, requiring building the Build.Config file.
In case there is an error indicating that Build.Config could not be found/resolved, go to Build -> Rebuild Project and it will be generated.
